Project Descriptions: The following are detailed descriptions of the project folders included in this repository.

Cattle Releaser System:
A safety-focused system designed to protect cattle during floods, fires, and other emergencies. The mechanism automatically releases confined cattle, allowing them to move freely and reducing the risk of injury or fatality. The project highlights automated actuation, environmental sensing, and disaster-response engineering.

Microcontroller-Based Timer Switch:
A programmable timer switch developed to control electrical appliances at predefined intervals. The work includes PCB design, firmware development, and a simple user interface for adjusting timing parameters. Key concepts include relay driving, switch debouncing, and stabilizing circuits when interfacing with mains-powered loads.

Warning System for Fog Settlement and Fire:
A dual-purpose environmental safety system designed to protect agricultural fields by detecting fog settlement and early fire indicators. The platform also provides real-time soil-moisture monitoring, enabling farmers to track and manage field conditions on a daily basis.

Construction-Site Pollution Monitoring System:
Low-cost IoT nodes developed for monitoring both indoor and outdoor air pollution around construction sites. The system integrates air-quality sensors, power management, and wireless communication to transmit data to a centralized dashboard. Field deployment involved designing rugged hardware capable of ensuring reliable and stable readings in harsh environments.

IoT-Based AQI Estimation Using Image Processing:
An IoT-enabled real-time AQI estimation system integrating image processing and machine learning to predict air quality levels using traffic imagery and weather-sensor data. The system achieves 82% accuracy through deep learning–based object detection and feature extraction, improving AQI estimation for dense urban areas.

GPS-Enabled Mobile Air Pollution Monitoring System:
A citywide mobile air-quality monitoring solution utilizing GPS-enabled IoT sensors mounted on moving vehicles to measure PM concentrations. The platform supports large-scale spatial and temporal data collection, enabling identification of pollution hotspots and seasonal air-quality variations.

IoT-Based Remote Laboratory Hardware System:
A remotely accessible laboratory hardware platform enabling students to control and observe experiments online. The system includes motor drivers, camera interfaces, and web-controlled actuation mechanisms, supporting demonstrations such as focal-length experiments. This setup enhances access to practical science education for institutions lacking laboratory infrastructure.

AutoBot BLE:
A Bluetooth Low Energy robotic bot developed using the ESP32. The system manages wireless communication, motor control, and real-time execution of directional commands. The project emphasizes low-latency embedded control, motor-noise isolation, and efficient wireless protocol handling.
